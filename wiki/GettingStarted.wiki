=Step 1 - Download=
First of all you have to download floatz from http://code.google.com/p/floatz/. The latest version is offered directly on the project home under "featured downloads" on the right side of the page. Alternatively check the [http://code.google.com/p/floatz/downloads/list downloads section] if you are interested in an other version.

floatz is available in two separate download packages: 

   * floatz.1.1.0.zip
   * floatz.dev.kit.1.1.0.zip

The first package is thought for production use and contains only what is really necessary. The second package contains additional files that are only interesting during development phase. The current tutorial considers only the production package. See WhatsInside for more information.

=Step 2 - Install=
Installation is pretty easy. Only unzip the downloaded file into a desired folder on your computer (e.g. into `C:\Program Files\floatz`). During installation, a separate subfolder is created, that contains also the version number of floatz (e.g. `C:\Program Files\floatz\floatz.1.1.0`).

=Step 3 - Prepare=

Before you can start using floatz, you have to prepare your project environment. The easiest way to achieve this, is by using one of the provided floatz templates or manually if you prefer starting with a blank file.

==Prepare your project by using a floatz template ==

The floatz development kit ships with a set of ready-to-use templates for different layouts as well as an empty layout template (see WhatsInside for an overview). The following instruction uses the empty layout template.

   * Create a project folder (e.g. `C:\Projects\MyProject`)
   * Copy the whole content of the desired template folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\floatz\floatz.dev.kit.1.1.0\templates\layout.empty\*.*`) into your project folder (e.g. `C:\Projects\MyProject`)
   * Rename the provided project stylesheet `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\project.css` to `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\MyProject.css`
   * Change the stylesheet import in `C:\Projects\MyProject\index.html` from `styles/project.css` to `styles/MyProject.css`. The code should look like this

   {{{
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/MyProject.css" />
   }}}

   * Optional: Open the project stylesheet `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\MyProject.css` and change the imported floatz CSS file from `floatz.liquid.css` to the desired layout stylesheet (e.g. `floatz.fixed.css` for fixed layout). The import should look like this:

   {{{
       @import url(floatz.1.1.0/floatz.fixed.css);
   }}}

   * Delete the floatz stylesheets from `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\floatz.1.1.0` you do not need (see `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\MyProject.css` what is imported).

That's it. Now you can start layouting your pages.

==Prepare your project manually ==

If you want to prepare your project manually, here's what you have to do:

   * Create a project folder (e.g. `C:\Projects\MyProject`) 
   * Create your projects CSS folder (e.g. `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles`)
   * Copy floatz from its installation directory (see above) into your project CSS folder (e.g. `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\floatz.1.1.0`)
   * Create your projects stylesheet within your projects CSS folder (e.g. `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\MyProject.css`) and add the following lines to it
   
   {{{ 
      /* Framework specific styles */
      @import url(floatz.1.1.0/floatz.fixed.css)

      /* Project specific styles */
   }}}

   ----
   Note: floatz comes in three different layout modes, each represented by its own stylesheet. Change the import statement to the particular file if you want to use liquid or center layout. Delete the ones you do not need from `C:\Projects\MyProject\styles\floatz.1.1.0`
   ----

   * Create your project start page (e.g. `C:\Projects\MyProject\index.html` and link to your project stylesheet.

   {{{
      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
         <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
            <head>
               <title>MyProject</title>
               <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; CHARSET=UTF-8" />
               <meta http-equiv="content-script-type" content="text/javascript" />
               <meta http-equiv="content-style-type" content="text/css" />
               <meta http-equiv="content-language" content="en" />
               <meta name="author" content="" />
               <meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />
               <meta name="description" content="" />
               <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/MyProject.css" />
            </head>
            <body>
               <!-- page container -->
               <div id="flz_page">
                   Hello World!
               </div>
            </body>
         </html>
   }}}

Now your project environment is up an running and you can start layouting your web pages using floatz.

For now, please have a look at the [http://code.google.com/p/floatz/source/browse/#svn/trunk/floatz.dev.kit/templates templates] and the [http://code.google.com/p/floatz/source/browse/#svn/trunk/floatz.dev.kit/tests test pages] that are part of the floatz development kit in version 1.1.0, that is currently in beta phase. They are currently not really sexy, but are showing the usage and some of the basic concepts of floatz. In the [http://code.google.com/p/floatz/source/browse/#svn/trunk/floatz.dev.kit/doc documentation folder] you will furthermore find a [http://code.google.com/p/floatz/source/browse/trunk/floatz.dev.kit/doc/floatz-cheat.sheet.pdf cheat sheet] that describes the basic layout elements of floatz.
