=Introduction=
Navigation is one of the most important concepts in web application. The appropriate means to that purpose are hyperlinks. But in practice the requirements on the look & feel of our navigation goes far beyond hyplinks: we need nice looking menus, tabboxes, toolbars with hover effects, highlighting and so on. The following wiki article shows a way how you can meet most of those requirements, without Javascript and multi-nested HTML tables - only with CSS and simple list elements. And if you need more, you can add additional effects to that light weight navigation solution with javascript based effects libraries like jQuery.
