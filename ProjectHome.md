# Project description #
**floatz is a flexible, powerful and easy to use CSS framework**. It provides a rich set of reusable CSS classes and code snippets that help web designers and programmers to build state of the art, semantic thus more accessible web sites and applications, based on web standards, in less time. The floatz framework is the result of many years using CSS in different kind of web based projects, trying to find a way to ease the use of CSS without always reinventing the wheel. It is used in different types of content based web sites as well as modern web applications and thus very robust.

## Highlights ##
The highlights of floatz can be summarized as follows
  * Flexible layouts
  * Better accessibility
  * Increased productivity
  * Less bandwidth
  * Broad browser support

### Flexible layouts ###
floatz provides a flexible layout system based on CSS floats (that's where its name comes from). Following a handful rules and assuming some practical experience, it is very easy to build **fixed as well as fluid web layouts**, with the possibility to switch between those layouts without changing code. The same layout mechanisms that are used to build the layout of a web page, can be used for structuring content as well as web forms. Especially the possibility to **build complex web forms** for business applications is a unique selling point of floatz.

### Better Accessibility ###
Experiences show that the use of valid, standard based, semantic markup increases the **readability of web sites** for humans as well as programs. That results in a better accessibility, especially for disadvantaged visitors using screen readers, better search engine rankings and an easier maintainability for programmers.

### Increased productivity ###
Starting with plain CSS can be (is) very hard and frustrating. Getting the deep knowledge that is necessary to provide viable CSS based web solutions on all browser platforms is time consuming. floatz **unifies established solutions** and necessary hacks due to browser incompatibilities into a pre-built set of CSS classes. The extensive use of CSS features like relative addressing, dynamic aspects, etc. as well as the use of semantic markup, increases the readability for developers and reduces the amount of unnecessary (and to be maintained) CSS classes as well as Javascript code. The flexibility of the floatz layouting system enables **prototyping and creating web based solutions in less time**.

### Less Bandwidth ###
A standard based web site using semantic HTML and utilizing the strengths of CSS, **reduces markup and CSS dramatically** in comparison to classic web layouts using HTML layout tables and CSS classes for everything. That means: less network traffic, shorter response times and a faster responsiveness, the cornerstones of modern Web 2.0 applications.

### Broad Browser support ###
floatz is tested and mostly **compatible to all leading browsers**. Potentially restrictions and workarounds will be covered in the documentation and in sample code.
  * Internet Explorer 6+
  * Firefox 1+
  * Opera 7+
  * Safari 3+
  * Chrome

# Project goals #
The primary goal of the floatz project is to build a set of CSS building blocks, package them into a **reusable framework** (avoiding copy/paste reuse) and save time in lots of web projects. The second goal and motivation to publish floatz as an open source project, is to **share it with others**, get useful input and maybe helping hands to develop further releases. The third goal is to bring the concepts of **purely CSS layouted web sites**, that are successfully used by web designers and creatives in countless web projects over years, nearer to the scene of classic web/application programmers where these concepts are often not so popular/or unknown and nested HTML layout tables (just one example) are still the common way to design web applications.
